Thank you for downloading my asset!

This is a PhantomSphere production, check us out at https://www.phantomsphere.com/. Feel free to send requests with ideas for new icons to be added!

This asset is simple to use, the icons are all in the "Icons" folder, just need to select them and drag wherever you want to use.

All of the icons were designed by using a fixed background color, so it's recommended that you use them in the same way,  cause otherwise the icons may not look as intended. The color is #3E3546.
